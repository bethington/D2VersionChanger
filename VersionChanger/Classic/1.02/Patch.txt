      Major bugs

******Game Hint/Spoiler******

  killing the Summoner) but exited the game without taking the portal 
  and establishing the waypoint in the Valley of the Magi. (Act II).

- patch 1.01
----------------------------------------------------------------

      Major bugs

- Fixed a bug that prevented you from getting credit for killing a
  quest boss, if you died before it did -- perhaps, by killing it
  with a poisoned weapon.
- Fixed a bug that could crash the game during the countdown after
  completing the final quest in Act IV, if the player used
  Waypoints to return to the earlier Acts.
- Fixed a hang bug that could occur if picking up gold while
  fleeing from a Gargantuan Beast (Act I).
- Fixed a crash bug that very rarely occurred when a Sorceress
  cast the Meteor spell.
- Fixed the "black screen" crash that could occur if one pressed
  'Alt-tab' during a cinematic.
- A Multiplayer Install running DirectDraw will no longer crash
  when one cancels the Cinematic selection menu.
- Fixed a bug that prevented two quest rewards from scaling up
  properly for Nightmare and Hell difficulty.
- Sand Leaper corpses no longer prevent players from moving through
  a tight pass in the Act II desert.
- Wounded Act II spiders no longer greatly reduce the frame rate.
- Lower-titled characters may now join Open games created by
  higher-titled characters (those who have completed the game in
  Normal, Nightmare, or Hell difficulty).
- Fixed a bug that prevented some complete Item Sets from having
  their full bonus.
- Fixed a bug in Open battle.net games that allowed a second player
  to create another game with the same name as an already existing
  game. No one could join the second one.
- Fixed a bug in TCP/IP games when a Town Portal was smothered in
  piles of gold, it could cause a player entering from the other
  end of the Portal to be disconnected from the Host.
- Fixed a bug that prevented interacting with the Stash, NPCs, or
  Waypoints if the player clicked on the Stash, then pressed 'H'
  before arriving at the Stash, and finally pressed 'H' again
  after arriving at the Stash.

      Minor bugs

- Removed an unused gossip from Ormus (Act III).
- Fixed a bug where if the 'Space bar' were assigned to another
  function, it would erroneously continue to close the Message Log,
  Quest Log, and Waypoint menu.
- Fixed a bug that occasionally allowed some monsters to enter the
  Act II town of Lut Gholein.

      Improvements

- Improved the stability of the servers and the behavior of clients
  when a server malfunctions.
- Changed the amount of gold dropped by a player who is killed by
  another player (PKed) to equal the amount that would normally be
  lost "to the void" as a death penalty when killed by a monster.
- Updated the ReadMe.htm to document the PK gold-drop penalty.
- Changed the text color for Blizzard Representatives in Diablo II
  chat rooms to yellow.
- Australian users connect to the USWest Realm instead of the Asia
  Realm.

******Game Hints/Spoilers******

- Fixed a crash bug that occurred upon entering the red Portal to
  the Canyon of the Magi, if a player had completed the Arcane
  Sanctuary quest, then saved and started a new game, before
  completing the Seven Tombs quest (Act II).
- Fixed a multiplayer bug that prevented a character from completing
  the final quest in Act II (and advancing to Act III), when joining
  a game started by a character who had already defeated the final
  boss, but who had not yet visited Meshif for the reward.
- Fixed the following 3 bugs that could occasionally crash the game:
  - Killing Lord De Seis (Act IV).
  - In Perspective mode Glide entering a Tomb in the Canyon
    of the Magi (Act II).
  - A multiplayer party fighting in the Kurast Bazaar (Act III).
- Fixed a bug that caused a quest item being held in the cursor to
  disappear when pressing the Horadric Cube's transmute button.
