  with whom the player is currently trading. Also, messages from players 
  outside the trade are squelched and will not appear in the message log.

  malicious masquerading.
- Chat colors have been adjusted to help players identify the source of 
  the text. The new chat colors are Name = Gold, Whisper = Green,

- Patch 1.03
----------------------------------------------------------------

      Major bugs

- Fixed a rare bug that would mark a character as "Unable to join, 
  Bad item." A typical cause of this bug was high lag conditions 
  while two characters simultaneously attempted to use the same 
  item lying on the ground - for example, a Necromancer casting 
  Iron Golem on a sword while another tried to pick it up.

  already select RAVE or OpenGL mode, you do not need to download this 
  update. The drivers can be downloaded from: 
  http://blizzard.com/support/diablo2/problems/macsoft.shtml (Mac only)
- Minor changes for Japanese and Korean support. 
- Fixed a bug that could cause crashes when playing in RAVE or OpenGL.
