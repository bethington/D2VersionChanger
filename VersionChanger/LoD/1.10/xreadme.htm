<b>WHAT'S NEW IN THE EXPANSION SET?</b>
<br><br>
Diablo II: Lord of Destruction contains a number of new features and exciting enhancements to the 
original Diablo II:
<ul>
<li><font color="blue">Two new character classes</font> - Command the forces of nature as the Druid, or use stealth and cunning as the Assassin. Each class possesses 30 unique new skills, offering totally different game-playing tactics.
<li><font color="blue">An entire new Act</font> - Explore the mysterious Barbarian Highlands, battle new monsters, and complete six exhilarating quests as you delve further into the epic Diablo mythos. Whether you are starting anew or continuing on with an established character, defeating Diablo at the end of Act IV opens the portal to new adventures in Act V.
<li><font color="blue">Increased Character Stash</font> - The Stash chest has doubled in size! Each Expansion Character can now store twice as much loot as before.
<li><font color="blue">Higher resolution</font> - By accessing the "Video Options," you now have the choice of playing Diablo II in either 640x480 or 800x600 mode. (Note: Playing Diablo II in 800x600 resolution can reduce system performance and is recommended only for high-end systems.)
<li><font color="blue">Class-Specific Items</font> - This class of items, new to Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, offers properties and powers specific to the seven different character classes.
<li><font color="blue">Improved Item Sets</font> - There are many fantastic new Set Items to be collected, endowing the wearer with even greater powers.
<li><font color="blue">New Insertable Items</font> - Jewels and Runes add even more magical possibilities when you insert them into items with sockets.
<li><font color="blue">New Exceptional Items</font> - Advanced players should be on the lookout for additions to the existing Exceptional Items.
<li><font color="blue">Elite Items</font> - This new class of items is similar to the Exceptional Items found in the higher difficulty levels of Diablo II…only better.
<li><font color="blue">New Unique Items</font> - More than a hundred mysterious ancient artifacts, including Exceptional and Elite Uniques, are just waiting to be discovered. 
<li><font color="blue">Hundreds of new magical properties</font> - Items of all levels can now possess greater and more diverse magical powers.
<li><font color="blue">Improved hirable NPC interface</font> - Players now have the ability to heal hirable NPCs as well as equip them with weapons and armor.
<li><font color="blue">New Horadric Cube recipes</font> - Numerous additional recipes for the Horadric Cube are just waiting to be discovered.

<li><font color="blue">Eight new skill hotkeys</font> - Additional hotkeys double the number of skills you can call upon with the lightning-fast stroke of a key.
<li><font color="blue">Interactive environments</font> - Carve your own path through Act V by destroying breakable wall sections, barricades, and siege towers.
</ul>

<a name="DETAILSONX"></a>
<hr>
<b>DETAILS ON SOME OF THE NEW FEATURES IN THE EXPANSION SET</b> 
<br><br>

Expansion Characters: After installing Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, you will have the option of 
choosing between two different "character types"-Standard and Expansion-when creating a new character. 
(Note: Do not confuse this with the two new character <i>classes</i>- the Druid and the Assassin.) Standard Characters are just like the characters you are used to playing in Diablo II, whereas Expansion Characters are specifically created for use in Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. You should be aware of some details before deciding which character type to create:
<ul><li>Expansion Characters can only create or join expansion games. They cannot create or join original Diablo II games.
<li>Standard Characters cannot use any of the new features or modifications found in Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, nor can they create or join Expansion games.
<li>Standard Characters can be converted permanently to Expansion Characters simply by accessing the "Select Character" screen, left-clicking on the Standard Character you wish to convert, and then left-clicking on the "Convert" button. 
<li>Converting a Standard Character is an irreversible, one-way process. Once a character has been converted to an Expansion Character, he or she can never be changed back to a Standard Character. Similarly, once an Expansion Character has been created, he or she can never be converted into a Standard Character.
</li></ul>
Corpse Recovery: 
In Nightmare and Hell difficulty settings, whenever your character dies, he or she suffers a loss of gold and experience points. In games of Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, if you recover your corpse at the location of its demise, you can regain some of the experience points you lost. If, however, you choose to 'Save and Exit' out of your current game in order to restart and recover your body in town, you will not regain any of your lost experience.
<br><br>Item Swapping: 
In Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, you have the ability to swap quickly between two sets of equipped 
weapon selections (i.e., right- and left-hand inventory slot configurations). To do this, merely 
open your Inventory screen and equip your character as you normally would. Next, left-click on either 
of the two tabs denoted by the Roman numeral "<b>II</b>" (or press the <font color="blue">W</font> key) to toggle between the two weapon 
configurations. Now equip your character with an additional two-handed weapon, a weapon and a shield, 
or (for Barbarians and Assassins) a pair of appropriate one-handed weapons. You can switch between the 
two weapon configurations at any time by pressing the <font color="blue">W</font> key or by clicking on the inactive weapon 
configuration's tab in your inventory screen (the inactive configuration is the one shaded a darker 
grey). <b>Note:</b> Your left and right mouse button skill setups are linked to your two weapon configurations. 
This allows you to customize your skill mouse buttons in order to complement your current weapon configuration.
Remember that your character must meet the requirements for any weapons you want to equip. Also, 
please keep in mind that only your currently selected weapon configuration is actively equipped. 
Any magical properties of items in your inactive configuration will not affect your character until 
you make that configuration active. For example, if you are currently using weapon configuration "<b>I</b>," 
any magical properties of items in configuration "<b>II</b>" have no effect until you make it your active configuration.
<br><br>Hirable Non-Player Characters ("Hirelings"): 
Diablo II: Lord of Destruction offers some exciting modifications to hirable NPCs. These computer-controlled hirelings who fight by your side can be hired from specific NPCs in most "towns"-the safe starting points in each Act-or are given free of charge as a reward for completing certain quests. In the original Diablo II, they followed your character around and helped you slay monsters, but you did not interact with them directly. In Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, you can increase their efficiency in combat and assist their development in a number of ways. (Note: These special new features only apply to hired NPCs and retainers acquired as quest rewards. Summoned creatures are not subject to these improvements.)
<ul><li>Attributes and Experience: Hirelings in Diablo II: Lord of Destruction come with their own set of attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Health, Damage, Defense, and Experience. As hirelings kill monsters, they gain experience points. When they gain enough experience points to reach a new level, their attributes automatically improve. You can also improve their attributes by equipping them with better equipment (see below). Keep in mind that hirelings aren't just paid mercenaries-they are co-adventurers. They fully share experience for their kills with you and your party, and they receive a smaller share of experience for monsters that you or your party members kill.
<li>Equipment: You can now furnish your hirelings with equipment such as armor, helms, and weapons. Your hirelings must meet all strength, dexterity, and level requirements for the item, and any weapons must be compatible with the hirelings' weapon type, as represented by what you see them carrying. (For instance, the Rogue hirelings in Act I can be equipped with a War Bow, but not a Short Sword, whereas the Town Guard hirelings in Act II can be equipped with a Voulge, but not a Crossbow.) To equip your hireling, simply left-click on the appropriate button on your Mini-panel or press the O key to bring up the Hireling Inventory and Information screen. Then place items in the corresponding slots as you would in your own Inventory screen.
<li>Healing: Previously in Diablo II, if you needed to heal your hireling, you had to return to town and visit the local healer. In Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, however, you can heal your hireling directly by left-clicking on a healing or rejuvenation potion in your backpack or belt and then dragging it over the hireling's gold-bordered portrait located in the upper left of the game screen. When the portrait is highlighted, left-click again to release the potion onto the portrait. You can also heal your hireling by visiting a healing Well.
<li>Hireling Continuity: Hirelings are now willing and able to accompany you to any of the various Acts of the game. In fact, you can actually finish the entire game through all three difficulty settings using only the first hireling received in Act I. You may choose to employ a new hireling at any time, but you may not take more than one hireling into your service at a time. If you choose to replace your current hireling with a fresh one, your old hireling will retire and be unavailable for further service. Before you replace a hireling, open the Hireling Inventory and remove any items you want to keep. Otherwise, you will lose that equipment.
<li>Death: When your hireling dies, you can return to the nearest mercenary captain and either pay to have your late comrade resurrected or hire a new one. If you choose to resurrect your hireling, he or she will return to your employ with all of the attributes, experience, and equipment he or she had at the time of death. If, however, you decide to employ a new hireling, you give up the services of the recently departed and forfeit any equipment he or she was wearing. <b>Note:</b> If your character dies, your hireling dies as well.
</ul>Automap Options: 
There is now an "Automap Size" selection in the "Automap Options" menu in Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. This new option allows you to choose between viewing the map as either the traditional full-screen Automap or the new, scaled-down "Mini Map." The Mini Map is about one quarter the size of the Automap and, when active, is displayed in one of the top corners of the game screen. You can switch this location from left to right by pressing the <b>V</b> hotkey.
<br><br>Repair All: 
You can now repair all of your outfitted items in a single step. To do this, go to the nearest "blacksmith" NPC (whoever repairs your equipment) and select "Trade or Repair" as you normally would. Blacksmiths still have the usual buttons for buying, selling, and repairing; in Expansion games, they also have an added "Repair All" button. This option allows you to repair all of the items that your character currently has equipped in a single operation. If you move your cursor over this button, the highlighted text shows the cost of this procedure, and pressing the button completes it. <b>Note:</b> The Repair All button only repairs equipped items. Any damaged items that your character is not wearing must be repaired individually.
<br><br>Fill Tome: 
By pressing the <b>Shift</b> key while right-clicking on a scroll you want to buy, you automatically purchase enough scrolls to fill the first unfilled Tome of that scroll type in your Inventory.
<br><br>Item Properties: 
As you adventure, keep in mind that even the regular magic items you find now have hundreds of new magical properties with many wondrous new effects to help your characters on their brave quests. They are far too numerous to list here, but keep an eye out for new magic item names; their explanations appear in the item's pop-up description. (This text, which explains the properties and requirements of the item, appears when you have your Inventory window open and highlight an item with your cursor.)
<br><br>Class-Specific Items: 
Items of this type can only be used by the character class for whom they were designed. In the original Diablo II, there were certain items that anyone could wield, but that had properties only accessible to certain classes (e.g., the Necromancer's wands or the Paladin's scepters). In Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, there are specific items that are only usable by their intended class, possessing special abilities only pertinent to that class. Be sure to pay close attention to the requirements of each item as listed in its pop-up description to see if an item is class specific.
<br><br>Elite Items: 
Elite Items are similar to the Exceptional Items found in the original Diablo II, but far more powerful. Exceptional Items are found in the higher difficulties (Nightmare and Hell), having the appearance of items from Normal difficulty games (both in the inventory and on the character), but with different names and substantially increased statistics. Elite items are of an even higher caliber than Exceptional items. Mostly found in Hell difficulty games, they possess new names and proportionately increased statistics, yet still retain the appearance of their corresponding Exceptional and normal versions.
<br><br>Set Items: 
Diablo II: Lord of Destruction introduces some exciting new improvements to Set Items. First and foremost, there are many new sets to collect, complete with brand-new bonus abilities. Rumors have been circulating about the many new relics and the powerful magics they grant to those who obtain them. Here are some other facts to be aware of:
<ul><li>Set Items are now scaled more directly to the difficulty of the Act in which they are found. For example, when you find a Set Item, you are more likely to be able to equip it right away.
<li>For some Sets, you no longer need to assemble the complete Set to receive its bonus abilities. You now receive partial bonuses for partially complete Sets.
<li>A Set Item can now have more than two magic properties.
</ul><br>
Socketed Items: When playing Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, you can now find "Socketed" versions of many more kinds of items, including armor and high-quality, magic, Rare, and even Unique items. Be sure to read the description of a Gem, Jewel, or Rune to see what abilities it imparts to the different item types.
<br><br>Insertable Items: In addition to the Gems in the original Diablo II, Diablo II: Lord of Destruction provides two new types of items that you can place into an item's empty sockets.
<ul><li>Jewels: Jewels are similar to Gems, except that instead of having predetermined magical abilities, like a Gem, each Jewel possesses random magic properties, allowing you to bestow a wide variety of magical abilities to your Socketed Item. Some uncommon Jewels can have two or more magical properties. Before inserting a Jewel, its magical properties must be "identified" either with a Scroll of Identity or by a wise sage who can provide such a service.
<li>Runes: Runes are small stones inscribed with magical glyphs that can be inserted into Socketed Items. Runes are different from other Insertable Items: not only do individual Runes have magical properties, certain combinations (or Rune Sets), when inserted into an item in the proper order, give that item even more wondrous abilities. To discover some of these Rune Sets, keep a sharp eye out for Scrolls of Knowledge. (See the section on Scrolls below.)
</ul>Charms: 
Charms are special magic items that grant magical enhancements without needing to be equipped to do so. Charms provide their abilities simply by being in the "Backpack" section of your character's Inventory. They do not function if placed inside your character's Stash or inside a Horadric Cube (even if that Horadric Cube is located in your hero's Backpack).
<br><br>Ethereal Items: 
Any type of armor or weapon, even one with magical properties, can be Ethereal. These items appear translucent in the Inventory, and when equipped, they appear translucent on the character wielding them. Their ethereal nature gives them an improved fundamental ability. However, they have decreased durability and cannot be repaired. Due to their extra-planar origins, Ethereal items often have requirements lower than those of an equivalent item.
<br><br>Charged Items: 
Some new magic items grant the use of certain skills to any character. Some of these items have skills that are only triggered under certain conditions, such as striking an enemy or being struck by one. Charged Items allow the wielder to use the skill at will, but only a limited number of times. To engage the skill granted by a Charged Item, left-click your right mouse button Skill Selection (or press the <b>S</b> key). The Charged Item skill is listed near the top of your list of available skills; left-click on its icon to select it. The skill can now be performed by right-clicking on a target. Charged Item skills have a limited number of uses, so be sure to check the item's pop-up description or the lower right-hand corner of the skill icon to see how many charges remain. If any of an item's charges are depleted, you can return to a nearby town and recharge the item by having the local Blacksmith repair it. 
<br><br>Scrolls: 
In addition to Scrolls of Town Portal and Identify, you might now occasionally come across Scrolls of Knowledge. The sole function of these scrolls is to provide the player with information. Specifically, they are inscribed with "recipes" for the various Rune and Horadric Cube combinations.

to bring up the appropriate screen or overlay.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-CTRLRUN"></a>
<b>Using Ctrl – Running</b>
<br>
Press and hold 'Ctrl' to run. Running outside towns uses Stamina.  Be careful not to 
let your Stamina run out if you are being chased. If your Stamina reaches zero, your 
character begins walking instead and cannot run. If that happens, you must release 
'Ctrl' and stand still for a few seconds to begin recovering Stamina. After your Stamina 
has started increasing, you may walk and continue to recover Stamina. This recovery 
continues until it reaches your character's maximum.
<br><br>
NOTE: You may also run by tapping the 'R' key to toggle auto-run mode on. Tap it again 
to go back to walking mode.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-ALT"></a>
<b>Using Alt – Highlighting Items on the Ground</b>
<br>
Press and hold 'Alt' to highlight any items (weapons, armor, potions, scrolls, gold, etc.) 
that you can pick up from the ground. The name of the item class appears above the item 
in the following color code: 
<br><br>
White = Normal Item<br>
Grey = Non-magical Socketed or Ethereal Items<br>
Blue = Magic Item<br>
Green = Set Item<br>
Yellow = Rare Item<br>
Gold = Unique Item
<br><br>
Click on the name (or the item, itself) to pick it up.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-SHIFT"></a>
<b>Using Shift – Standing and Attacking</b>
<br>
When you want to attack with the left or right mouse button skill without moving 
to the target of the attack, hold the 'Shift' key down.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-MONSTERS"></a>
<b>Information on Monsters</b>
<br>
When you move your cursor over a monster, you see the monster's name or class. 
Behind the name in red appears the monster's hit-point bar graph, showing how much 
of the monster's life remains. The name of the monster is color-coded. White text 
indicates a standard monster type, blue a champion, and gold a unique monster or boss.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-STACKABLE"></a>
<b>Stackable Items</b>
<br>
Some items can have a quantity greater than one. Examples include: tomes of identify 
and town portal, keys, and all items that can be thrown or shot by a bow -- arrows, 
bolts, throwing knives, javelins, exploding potions, etc. Using a stackable item 
reduces its quantity by one. When the quantity of a projectile reaches zero, the 
item is gone. Empty tomes can be refilled with scrolls.
<br><br>
You may consolidate stackable items of the same type (like quivers of arrows) by picking 
up one stack and dropping it onto another stack. The quantities in both stacks combine to 
form one stack, unless the resulting stack's quantity exceeds the maximum. In that case, 
you are left with two stacks, one holding the maximum number of the item, and the other 
hold any remainder. 
<br><br>
NOTE: You cannot split a stack into two stacks.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-SCROLLS"></a>
<b>Scrolls</b>
<br>
There are only two types of scrolls in Diablo II - Scrolls of Town Portal and Scrolls of Identify. 
Scrolls of Knowledge have been added to Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. Several scrolls of the same 
type may be held within a single tome. In Act I Akara sells scrolls and tomes from her Miscellaneous 
inventory tab. 
<br><br>
Right-click on the Town Portal scroll (or tome) to open up a portal near the 
player. Left-click on the Portal to return to the town located in that Act. The 
portal remains active until you re-enter it within the Act's town and return 
to the place from which you cast it.
<br><br>
Right-click on the Identify scroll (or tome) to change the cursor into a tilted 
question mark. Move the point of the cursor over an unidentified item in your 
inventory and Left-click to identify it.
<br><br>
Right-click on a Knowledge scroll to read it.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-BELT"></a>
<b>Using the Belt</b>
<br>
Pressing one of the 4 belt hotkeys uses the item in the corresponding belt 
hot-slot – 1, 2, 3, or 4. Only scrolls or potions of health, mana, stamina, 
thawing, and antidote can be placed in the belt. Pressing the belt hotkey 
either drinks the potion or casts the spell contained on a scroll.
<br><br> 
Wearing a sash, or larger belt, expands the basic 4-slot belt by adding 1 or 
more extra rows of 4 slots. You can access the extra rows by moving the cursor 
over the 4-slot belt in the control panel. When an item in a belt hot-slot is 
used, any items held in the storage slots above the (now empty) hot-slot drop 
down one slot to refill it. For maximum convenience you should arrange items of 
the same type vertically. You can also use the '~' key to toggle larger belts 
fully open and closed.
<br><br> 

<a name="HT-SKILLS"></a>
<b>Skills</b>
<br>
All Character Classes start with the same 2 basic skills – Attack and Throw.
<ul>
<li>"Attack" uses an equipped weapon (or weapons, in the case of the Barbarian) 
to do damage.
<li>"Throw" hurls a throwing weapon or potion at an enemy.
</ul>
Necromancers, Amazons, Druids, and Assassins  also start with the "Unsummon" skill to dismiss minions previously 
summoned by the player.
<br><br>
Each character class may develop 30 more unique skills. These 30 additional skills 
are divided into 3 skill tabs. The skills in each tab are arranged into a 
Skill Tree -- much like a Technology Tree in a real-time strategy game.
<br><br>
There are two general classes of skills – Passive and Active. Active skills require 
you to explicitly cast or use them. Passive skills are not cast, but have implicit 
or automatic effects. Masteries (a type of Passive skill) are in effect whenever 
the item or skill to which the Mastery applies is used. The Paladin's Auras (another 
type of Passive skill) are in effect whenever readied as the right mouse skill button. 
Aura skill button icons are golden.
<br><br>
All Active skills except Attack, Throw, Unsummon and Sacrifice use Mana. Most Passive 
skills do not use Mana.  The Mana cost and other information about a skill is shown 
when you move the cursor over the skill icon.  When a Skill icon is red, the Skill 
cannot be used. This is due to either a lack of Mana, or because an item that the 
skill requires is not equipped.
<br><br>
The different skill tabs are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Amazon: Javelin and Spear Skills, Passive and Magic Skills, Bow and Crossbow Skills.
<li>Sorceress: Cold Spells, Lightning Spells, Fire Spells.
<li>Barbarian: Warcries, Combat Masteries, Combat Skills.
<li>Paladin: Defensive Auras, Offensive Auras, Combat Skills.
<li>Necromancer: Summoning Spells, Poison and Bone Spells, Curses.
<li>Druid: Elemental, Shape-shifting, Summoning. 
<li>Assassin: Martial Arts, Shadow Disciplines, Traps.
</ul>
NOTE: Equipping a throwing weapon readies the Throw Skill in the left mouse skill 
button. When you've thrown the last one of a stack of throwing weapons, the skill (along with 
the weapon) you had been using before is restored to the left mouse skill button, 
(unless the weapon was a bow or crossbow).
<br><br>

<a name="HT-HOTKEYS"></a>
<b>Assigning and Using Skill Hotkeys</b>
<br>
You may assign 16 hotkeys to automatically ready skills for the left or right mouse 
buttons. Bring up the Skill buttons (left-click on the left-hand or right-hand 
skill icon), then move the cursor over each skill and press one of the 16 
hotkeys – 'F1' through 'F8' – to assign the hotkey to that skill. When finished, 
press 'S' or the Spacebar.
<br><br>
NOTE: Some skills cannot be assigned to the left mouse button. Any skill can be 
assigned to the right mouse button.
<br><br> 

<a name="HT-INTERACTNPCS"></a>
<b>Interaction with NPCs</b>
<br>
Click on an NPC. If a text menu pops up, you can interact. Select 'Talk' to hear 
the NPC introduction, gossip, or quest information. Select 'Trade' to buy, sell, 
or repair items. (See below.) In Act I, for example, Gheed allows you to 'Gamble'
by offering an inventory of unidentified magic items – premium-priced, however. 
Kashya lets you 'Hire' or 'Resurrect' a mercenary after completing a certain quest for her. 
(See below.) Charsi can 'Imbue' an item with rare magical properties after you 
complete her quest.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-TRADENPCS"></a>
<b>Trading with NPCs</b>
<br>
Click on one of the NPCs (Akara, Gheed, or Charsi in Act I). Select 'Trade' 
from the pop-up menu. Your Inventory appears on the right side of the screen, 
while the NPC's Inventory appears on the left. Across the top of the NPC inventory 
are 4 inventory tabs – Armor, Weapons, Magical, and Misc. If there are no items in 
that tab, the tab label will not appear until someone sells the NPC an item of that type. 
<ul>
<li>Buying: Click on the tabs that interest you. Your character cannot equip items 
with a red background color. Sweep your cursor over the items in the NPC's inventory 
and study the pop-up descriptive text. The cost in gold along with other attributes 
is listed. Attribute requirements that your character does not meet appear in red text. 
When you find an item you want to buy, left-click on it. The "Buy" menu pops up. Click 
on "Yes" to buy, "No" to cancel.
<li>Selling: Sweep your cursor over the items in your inventory and study the 
pop-up descriptive text. The sell value in gold appears at the top. Left-click 
on an item you want to sell (which picks it up) and move the item over to the 
NPC's inventory. Left-click again to drop the item and exchange it for gold. Be 
certain that you want to sell an item when you drop it into the NPC's inventory. 
Otherwise, you can buy it back, but only at a premium!
<li>Repairing: (Only Charsi, the smith, offers this service in Act I.) Click on 
the "Anvil" repair button near the bottom of the NPC inventory. Sweep the cursor 
over items in your inventory. Note the repair cost in the pop-up window for each 
item. Left click on the item to repair it (restore it to maximum durability.) Repeat 
for each item. Click on the "Anvil" button again when finished. Any item with 0 
durability must be repaired before it can be used. You may click on the "Repair All" 
button to repair all currently equipped items. 
</ul>
NOTE: When an equipped item's durability is low, a color-coded player icon appears 
in the upper right corner of the screen. Items displayed in yellow have low 
durability. Items in red have 0 durability and cannot be used (have no effect) 
until repaired. Bring up your Inventory and sweep your cursor over your equipment 
to inspect its durability.
<br><br>
NOTE: To buy or sell multiple items click on the corresponding Trading Mode buttons 
near the bottom of the NPC inventory. This sets the cursor into buy or sell mode. 
Left click on each item in turn for the mode you selected. To change modes click on 
one of the three Trading Mode buttons. Click on the "Close" button to exit.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-MERCS"></a>
<b>Hiring and Controlling Mercenaries</b>
<br>
In Act I Kashya hires out mercenary Rogues after you have completed a 
certain quest for her. 
<br><br>
Click on Kashya to bring up her menu. If "HIRE" appears on her menu, click on it. 
Select a mercenary to hire. Press "OK." A Rogue appears near you with her icon 
in the upper left corner. Above the icon is the Rogue's Health bar. The Rogue 
follows you and automatically shoots arrows at any monsters or hostile players 
nearby. You cannot harm your mercenaries and they cannot harm you or your party 
members.
<br><br>
Mercenaries cost gold to hire. Mercenaries are very loyal and fight to the death. 
They follow you through portals, waypoints, and acts.
<br><br> 

<a name="HT-TRADING"></a>
<b>Trading with other Players</b>
<br>
To request a trade with another player, click on that player while in 
town together. (You cannot trade outside town.)
<br><br>
A dialog box pops up that says "Waiting for Other Player," along with a "Cancel" button. 
The player you selected will see a dialog box containing "Agree to Trade?" and "OK/Cancel." 
You can wait until the other player clicks on "OK" or "Cancel," or you can retract your 
invitation by clicking on "Cancel.".
<br><br>
If the other player accepts and clicks on "OK," then the Player Trading Screen 
comes up. On the right side of the screen is your Inventory. On the left is the 
Trading Block. The top half of the block contains what the other player is 
offering for trade. The bottom half is your offer.
<br><br>
Move items between your Inventory and your half of the Trading Block, while 
your trading partner does the same. You may adjust the amount of gold in your 
offer by clicking on the "Gold" button in your half of the Trading Block.
<br><br>
When you are satisfied with the deal, click on the check mark. The other player 
agrees in the same manner. When the other player's check mark turn 
green, he/she has agreed to the trade.
<br><br>
You may cancel a trade by clicking on the "Cancel" button at the bottom of 
the screen or by pressing the <b>Esc</b> key.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-PARTIES"></a>
<b>Forming Parties with other Players</b>
<br>
Press the <b>P</b> key to bring up the Party screen. You see a list of all the players 
in the game and your current relationships to them.  Names appearing white are 
Neutral, green are in your Party, and red are Hostile. Next to each available 
player's name is the Party button with one of the following labels:
<br><br>
INVITE:	Press this button to invite the player to join your party.<br>
CANCEL: After inviting the player (but before acceptance), you may 
withdraw the invitation by pressing this button again.<br>
ACCEPT: The player has invited you to join a party. Press this button to 
accept the invitation.
<br><br>
If no button appears, then the player is not available – because that 
player is already a member of another party. You may not invite them until 
they leave their current party. Of course, they could invite you to join theirs.
<br><br>
Once in a party you may leave it by pressing the LEAVE button at the top of the 
party screen.  If you leave a party of more than two players, the other players 
remain in that party. Once you leave a party, you may form or join another.
<br><br>
To the right of each player's Party button are 4 smaller buttons – each of which 
can be ON or OFF. The first one is the Neutral/Hostile button. When the button 
shows crossed swords, you are Hostile to the associated player. The second one 
is the Allow/Prevent Corpse Looting button. NOTE: Corpse Looting is allowable 
only for Hardcore characters. The third is the Include/Exclude 
from Chat button. When you Exclude a player, that player cannot hear or see any 
verbal communication coming from you. The last is the Squelch/Unsquelch button. 
When you Squelch a player, you cannot hear or see any communication 
coming from that player.
<br><br>
NOTE: When you press your Party or Hostility buttons, the target player receives 
an appropriate message about your action.
<br><br>
 
<a name="HT-PARTYRELATIONS"></a>
<b>Party Relationships</b>
<br>
Each player has two possible relationships with all other players in the game -- 
Neutral (the default) and Hostile. Changes to your relationships are made in the 
Party screen. (Press 'P' to bring it up.) Here is how the settings work:
<ul>
<li>Hostile: You can target players with this setting – just as if they were monsters. 
In order for Player X to go hostile to Player Y, Y must be Level 9 or higher. When 
Player X goes Hostile to Player Y, X's Town Portal (if one) closes and Player Y 
automatically goes Hostile to Player X in return. Hostile players can use only their 
own Town Portals. If Player X goes Hostile to Player Y and then goes Neutral, Player Y 
remains Hostile to Player X until Player Y chooses to go Neutral to Player X. 
<i>A player can go Hostile only while in town. The other player can be anywhere. If a 
player goes Hostile to a fellow Party member, that player is simply dropped from the 
Party and becomes a regular Neutral.</i>
<li>Neutral: You cannot target players with this setting. If you try to target a 
particular Neutral player, the true target instead shifts to a nearby monster, Hostile 
player, or simply the ground. You cannot directly harm a Neutral player.
<i>Neutral players may form a Party together. Party members share equally in gold and 
in proportion to their levels in experience points (with a small bonus to the player 
who delivers the killing blow). Some quest rewards are given to all members of a party, 
if at least one party member has earned the reward. Certain skills, like Paladin Auras 
and Barbarian Warcries, apply to party members, too.</i>
</ul>
NOTE: You receive a message whenever players change their relationship settings with you.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-GOLD"></a>
<b>Gold</b>
<br>
The Gold button appears on the Backpack (Inventory) screen. Press it to select an 
amount of gold to either drop or offer in trade with another player. The amount of 
gold you can carry is determined by your character's level – 10,000 gold per level.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-STASH"></a>
<b>Your Stash</b>
<br>
In a central location in each town (near the bonfire in the Rogue camp in Act I) 
is a large chest. This is your private Stash. Click on it to open it. You may 
exchange items between your Character Inventory and your Stash. You may also 
deposit into your Stash a maximum amount determined by your character's level. 
Merchants will deduct gold from your 
Stash for purchases that exceed the amount of gold you are carrying. Click on the 
exit button or press 'Esc' or Spacebar to exit.
<br><br>
NOTE: Don't leave items lying on the ground any longer than necessary. Regular 
items disappear in about 15 minutes. Magic, Rare, Set, and Unique items disappear 
after lying on the ground for about 1 hour.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-GEMS"></a>
<b>Gems and Socketed Items</b>
<br>
Items whose names appear in grey text have one or more sockets. The sockets are visible when 
highlighting the item in your inventory. You can place various types and grades of gems into 
the sockets to enhance a socketed item's abilities. There are five grades of gems - chipped, 
flawed, standard, flawless, and perfect. Gems cannot be removed from a socket once placed into it. 
Touching a gem shrine upgrades one gem (randomly chosen from the character's inventory) to the 
next higher grade.<br> 
Jewels and Runes may also be placed into empty item sockets. Jewels have fixed magic properties, 
while Runes may be part of a set which must be inserted in the proper order for bonus effects.

<br><br>
 
<a name="HT-SETS"></a>
<b>Magic, Rare, Set, and Unique Items</b>
<br>
The names of Magic, Rare, Set, and Unique Items appear in blue, yellow, green, 
and gold text, respectively.
<ul>
<i>Magic Items</i> have one or two magical attributes applied to the basic item. Rare Items, 
besides an appropriate two-word name, have 3 to 5 magical attributes.<br>
<i>Set Items</i> are uniquely named and have several magic attributes. There is a bonus for 
being equipped with some or all of the items of a Set.<br>
<i>Unique Items</i> have unique names and attributes.<br>
</ul>

<a name="HT-LEVELING"></a>
<b>Leveling Up and Allocating Stats and Skill Points</b>
<br>
When a character levels up by earning enough experience points 
(from killing monsters), the "New Stats" and "New Skill" buttons appear at the 
bottom left and right corners of the screen. When in a safe situation, click 
on the buttons to bring up the Character Attributes and the Skill Tree to allocate 
the points.
<br><br>
Each time you level up, you may distribute 5 attribute points among your 4 
attributes – strength which effects damage, dexterity which effects the ability 
to hit and avoid attacks, vitality which effects life, and energy which effects 
Mana. Click on the "+" button next to an attribute to increment that attribute.
<br><br>
Each time you level up, you may add 1 point to an available skill. The
skills available to you must satisfy both a player level requirement and 
any skill prerequisites higher up on the tree. Click on all 3 tabs and 
sweep your cursor over the available skills (appearing in bright white) 
to review their descriptions and detailed effects before making your selection.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-WAYPOINTS"></a>
<b>Waypoints</b>
<br>
In Act I the Rogue encampment contains one Waypoint. Others can be found outside 
the towns scattered throughout the Acts. When you encounter other Waypoints, 
click on them to activate them. Once a Waypoint has been activated, you may travel 
instantly from it to any other Waypoints you've activated.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-SHRINES"></a>
<b>Shrines and Wells</b>
<br>
There are shrines and wells outside the towns. Each has a descriptive name that 
appears when you move the cursor over the shrine. To activate one of these mystic 
places, Left-click on it to trigger the effect. Shrine effects wear off after a 
period of time. Only one shrine at a time can affect a player – the one most recently 
touched. Wells and most shrines can be used more than once – after a period of time 
they recharge.
<br><br>
 
<a name="HT-AUTOMAP"></a>
<b>Using the Automap</b>
<br>
Press <b>Tab</b> to toggle the Automap on or off. When the Automap is displayed, use 
the arrow keys to scroll it around. To re-center the fullscreen Automap, just toggle it 
off and on again. The Automap is colored-coded as follows:
<ul>
Blue Cross: Your character<br>
Yellow Cross: Open Town Portal<br>
White: NPC's<br>
Red: Hostile and Neutral players<br>
Bright Green: Party members<br>
Light Blue: Summoned monsters under your control<br>
Dark Green: Summoned monsters under your party's control<br>
Purple: Your corpse<br>
</ul>
In Act I follow the path out of the Rogue camp into the wilderness. You may 
want to "scour" the landscape so that you don't miss anything important. Along 
with rivers, paths, walls, fences, houses, cliffs, and the like, major 
landmarks appear – caves, shrines, wells, waypoints, and quest areas.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-QUESTS"></a>
<b>Quests</b>
<br>
The Quest Log button pops up in the lower left corner of the screen when the 
state of a quest changes. Click on it to bring up the Quest Log and review your 
quests.
<br><br>
The Quest Log button always appears when beginning or completing a quest. Some 
quests are given by NPCs – others by happening upon an important part of the quest.
<br><br>
The creator of a game determines which quests appear in a game. When a player 
character creates a game, only those quests that have not been completed by 
that character can be active in that game.
<br><br>
If a character joins a game containing an active quest that has already been 
completed by that character, then that character cannot earn an additional reward 
for assisting in the quest completion. Further, the NPCs will not discuss such a 
quest with a character that has already completed it.
<br><br>
If a character has completed a quest that includes a boss monster and/or special 
area and then starts a new game, the boss and/or location of the quest is 
generally placed in the game. However, the quest is not activated and the reward 
is not given a second time.
<br><br>
For most quests, when completed by a player who is a member of a party, the other 
party members receive some portion of the reward. Uncooperative or malicious 
players can interfere with your successful completion of some of the quests. You 
may exit, create a new game (with a password to keep out the riff-raff), and try 
the quest again.
<br><br>
 
<a name="HT-CHARSAVE"></a>
<b>Character Saving/Loading and Corpses</b>
<br>
Periodically, Diablo II: Lord of Destruction automatically saves your character as you play. Your 
character is also saved when you choose "Save and Exit Game" from the 'Esc' Menu.
<br><br>
The state of the Automap and the random world layout is saved in Single Player 
games, but not when playing on Battle.net or in other Multiplayer games.
<br><br>
If you die and leave a game without retrieving your corpse, at the beginning of 
your next game with that character your corpse is placed within the town of that 
Act.
<br><br>
The character save data includes Character Attributes, Inventory, Skills, Skill 
Hotkeys, Control Configuration, Waypoints Activated, the character's Corpse (if 
there is one), the list of completed Quests, and the contents of the character's 
Stash.
<br><br>
NOTE: Only you (and those you permit) may loot your corpse.
<br><br>

<a name="HT-DEATH"></a>
<b>What Happens When Your Character Dies</b>
<br>
Your character loses a percentage of the total gold both carried and stored in 
the Stash. The percentage is equal to your character level -- but not to 
exceed 20%. After deducting the death penalty from the gold your character is 
carrying, the rest falls to the ground in a pile. If the penalty uses up the gold 
being carried, the remainder of the penalty is deducted from the Stash.
<br><br>
However, in Single Player the death penalty will not take away all your gold. 
No gold is taken from the Stash and 500 gold per character level is exempt 
from the death penalty. For example, if a level 10 Single Player character 
with 5,000 gold dies, no gold is lost.
<br><br>
As an additional death penalty, in Nightmare and Hell difficulty levels your character 
loses some experience, but will not drop down to a lower character level. However, if 
you retrieve (loot) your own corpse where it died, you recover some of the lost experience.
<br><br>
If your character currently has no corpse, one is created and your equipped items stay 
on your corpse. <b>BEWARE!</b> If your character already has a corpse, equipped items simply fall 
to the ground along with gold where anyone could pick them up. Unequipped items always 
remain in your inventory.
<br><br>
Press the <b>Esc</b> key to be reincarnated in the Act town. Your reborn character holds 
the unequipped portion of the recently deceased's inventory. This is a good time to 
consider visiting your Stash to make a withdrawal of some spare equipment.
<br><br>
When you find your corpse, click on it to loot it of all equipped items. Only you 
(and those you permit) may loot your corpse.
<br><br>
If you exit a game without looting your corpse, it will be placed in town in the 
next game you create or join.
<br><br>
NOTE: If your character was created "Hardcore," it is never reincarnated – you simply 
find yourself as a ghost in the Battle.net chat channel.

<b>MULTIPLAYER DIABLO II: LORD OF DESTRUCTION</b>
<br><br>

<a name="MULTI-BN"></a>
<b>Battle.net</b>
<br>
Battle.net is an Internet gaming service provided by Blizzard Entertainment which 
allows players to meet up, challenge other players, join games, and compete in a 
worldwide ranking system, all without paying any special connection charges.
<br><br>
In order to use Battle.net, your computer must have the TCP/IP protocol installed, 
and must provide TCP/IP support for 32-bit applications.  If you connect to the 
Internet using Windows Dial-up Networking, and browse the web with Netscape Navigator 
version 2.0 or higher or Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0, then you probably already 
have the correct TCP/IP software installed.  However, if you connect to the Internet 
with a proprietary dialer or browse the web with Netscape 1.x or another 16-bit web 
browser, then it is likely that your system is not configured to support 32-bit 
applications.  In this case, you should contact your Internet Service Provider to 
obtain updated software.
<br><br>
<i>"I can chat with other users, but I can't join a game."</i>
<br>
In order to play in a multiplayer game, your system must be able to receive packets 
of game data (technically, UDP and TCP packets) from other players.  Some service 
providers don't allow incoming data of this type, or don't provide users with a unique 
Internet address to which packets can be sent.  If you are unsure whether your provider 
is blocking this type of connection, please contact them for more information.
If you are trying to play Diablo II through a computer that is directly connected to 
the Internet through your employer or other organization, you should be aware that some 
companies block certain types of incoming data to their networks.  To play multiplayer 
games on Battle.net, you may have to ask your network administrator to allow incoming 
UDP and TCP packets on port 6112.
<br><br>
<i>"Players are crashing my game while we are playing!"</i>
<br>
It has come to our attention that certain users are taking advantage of security flaws 
in Windows 95 and NT to crash other users in the Battle.net games. Microsoft has 
released fixes for these flaws for both Win95 and NT.  The fixes prevent most, but not 
all of these programs from being used on you. Search Microsoft's web site at 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/search/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/search/default.asp</a>
 for both "Out-of-Band" and "Invalid ICMP Datagram Fragments".  Also check Microsoft's 
 web site at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</a> for any new security fixes.

<b>America Online</b>
<br>
To connect to Battle.net through AOL, you will need to use the 32-bit Windows 95 
AOL client software. If you are unsure as to whether you already have this, 
please contact AOL directly.

<a name="MULTI-LAN"></a>
<b>Local Area Network</b>
<br>
Diablo II supports multiplayer gaming over IPX compatible networks.  If your computer 
is connected to a local area network, but you are not sure whether it is IPX 
compatible or not, ask your network administrator.
<br><br>
<i>"I have IPX but I can't join a game, or people can't see my game to join it."</i>
<br>
Diablo II will not play across network segments.  If you are not sure whether your 
network is segmented or not, contact your network administrator.  You should also verify 
that all computers on the network are using the same frame type.  You can change the 
frame type that a computer uses in the Windows 95/98 Network control panel or in the 
Windows NT Network control panel.
<br><br>
For Windows 95/98/ME

<a name="MULTI-MODEM"></a>
<b>Modem and Serial Connections</b>
<br>
Diablo II: Lord of Destruction supports only TCP/IP connections for multiplayer games, but neither direct 
modem nor serial (null-modem) connections. 
<br><br>
Of course, you may use a modem to connect to an ISP (Internet Service Provider). You 
can play a Realm character by connecting to and logging on to Battle.net or you can 
play an Open character by selecting the OTHER MULTIPLAYER option and then selecting 
OPEN BATTLE.NET or TCP/IP.
<br><br>
If you select a TCP/IP game, the game server runs on one player's computer. This 
player must tell the other players (perhaps via an instant messaging service like ICQ) 
the IP address to enter when attempting to connect with the server.

to help you resolve any problems that you may experience with Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. 
<br><br>
Please note that Realm characters are stored on Blizzard's Battle.net servers 
and may be deleted by Blizzard Entertainment when abandoned by the Battle.net 
account owner who created them. Such abandonment is determined by the same 
rules that apply to Battle.net accounts. To prevent the deletion of one of your 
Realm characters, be sure to play it long enough upon creation and often enough 
thereafter to prevent abandonment. For details please refer to the warning message 
which appears when you create a new Realm character.

<b>PERFORMANCE TIPS</b>
<br><br>

<a name="PERF-VIDTEST"></a>
<b>Video Test and Performance</b>
<br>
The Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Installer screen provides the Video Test option. You may choose from the 
available video modes to improve performance on your computer.
<br><br>
This option allows you to select hardware 3D acceleration modes, or to run in DirectDraw (2D) 
software mode. To offer 3D accelerated modes your video card must have at least 8 MB of 
texture RAM installed on it. Choosing Glide or Direct3D acceleration generally improves 
performance greatly.
<br><br>

<a name="PERF-MUSIC"></a>
<b>Music and Performance</b>
<br>
Disabling music in Diablo II: Lord of Destruction reduces the amount of work your processor has to do. This may improve 
performance on older or slower computers.
<ol>
<li>To disable music in Diablo II, press the Esc key.
<li>Then, click on the Sound Options item in the menu that appears.
<li>Next, click on the Music Volume slider and drag it all the way to the left.
<li>Press Esc again to return to the game.
</ol>

<a name="PERF-VIDOPTS"></a>
<b>Video Options and Performance</b>
<br>
Various graphics options may be adjusted to improve performance.
<ol>
<li>To adjust the video options, press the Esc key.  
<li>Next, click on the Video Options item in the menu that appears.
</ol>

<a name="RESOLUTION"></a>
<b>Resolution</b>
<br>
This option adjusts the resolution of the game display. There are two settings: 640x480 and 800x600. Setting this option to 640x480 increases performance.
<br><br>

<a name="PERF-LIGHTING"></a>
<b>Lighting Quality</b>
<br>
This option adjusts the smoothness of the lighting. There are three quality 
settings: LOW, MEDIUM, and HIGH. Setting this option to LOW increases performance.
<br><br>

<a name="PERF-SHADOWS"></a>
<b>Blended Shadows</b>
<br>
This option blends the shadows on the screen. Turning this option OFF increases performance.
<br><br>

<a name="PERF-PERSPECTIVE"></a>
<b>Perspective Mode (not available in DirectDraw)</b>
<br>
This option dynamically scales parts of the world to simulate the visual effect of 
perspective view. Turning this option OFF makes the game look less 3-Dimensional 
and increases performance.
<br><br>

<a name="PERF-CDCACHE"></a>
<b>CD Cache Performance</b>
<br>
You can change the cache size of your CD-ROM to increase performance 
and decrease CD load times. To do this:
<ol>
<li>Opening the Start Menu
<li>Select Settings
<li>Choose the Control Panel folder
<li>Open the System control panel
<li>Select the Performance tab
<li>Click on the File Systems button
<li>Select the CD-ROM tab
</ol>
CD-ROMs use different cache sizes and access patterns. So, you may need to 
experiment with these to find the optimum setting for your CD-ROM. If you 
have 32MB of RAM, you should set your cache size as small as possible. 
<br><br>

<a name="PERF-BGAPPS"></a>
<b>Background Applications and Performance</b>
<br>
Programs that run in the background while on the Internet, such as ICQ, web 
browsers, voice communication applications, Pointcast, or Netcast cut into 
the speed at which Diablo II plays.  Turning off these Internet-specific 
applications can also increase your game speed.
<br><br>

<a name="PERF-SYSRAM"></a>
<b>System RAM and Performance</b>
<br>
Another method of increasing performance in Diablo II is to add RAM to your 
computer if you are playing on a 32MB system.  Windows 95/98 uses about 5 MB 
of your available RAM, and this causes Diablo II to use virtual memory. This 
process is slower than using RAM directly, and while the speed of your 
processor is a factor in the performance of the game, additional memory can 
greatly enhance your game speed on baseline systems.
<br><br>

<a name="PERF-3DACCEL"></a>
<b>3D Accelerators and Performance</b>
<br>
To increase performance over DirectDraw (2D) install a 3D accelerator video 
card with at least 8 MB of texture RAM which supports the Glide or Direct3D 
API.

<b>UNINSTALLING</b>

<a name="UNINST-D2"></a>
<b>Uninstalling Diablo II</b>
<br>
To uninstall Diablo II follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Click on the Start menu
<li>Choose Programs
<li>Select Diablo II
<li>Click on the Uninstall Icon
</ol>
When uninstalling Diablo II, your saved games and your Open characters are not deleted. If you 
wish to delete them, you must delete them by hand. Your Battle.net Account along with your 
Diablo II Realm characters will remain on Battle.net and you may still play over Battle.net 
from any system that has Diablo II installed.
<br><br>
For users who are running both Windows 9X and Windows 2000/NT 4.0 on their systems, please note 
that you must uninstall Diablo II from the same OS where it was installed. For instance, if 
you install Diablo II under Windows 9X, you must uninstall from Windows 9X as well.
