      <LI>It may also be possible that if you've chosen a simple to guess password such as "god", "money", or a word related to your account name like Name: Billy Password: Bob, then somone has guessed your password and changed it.  We do not retain records of older passwords and thus are unable to verify previous ownership of accounts.  We cannot change passwords if they have been altered by another user. 
      <LI>We suggest you use alpha-numeric passwords containing both numbers and letters of 6 or more characters long.
      <LI>Don't tell others your password.
