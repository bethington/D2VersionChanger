    <B>What is lag?</B>
  <UL>
    Lag is another word for Latency.

    <P>Latency is a measure of the quality of your internet connection. Many factors contribute to your latency (including but not exclusive to the performance of your system and the speed of your internet service provider). Your latency has a large impact on the speed of games you play over the internet, so we have developed a system for users to easily gauge their latency, and the latency of others.
