<!--- Joining Channels -------------------------->
<P>
To join a channel on battle, click on the <b>Channel</b> button in your battle.net interface.  Select a channel from the list, or 
manually type in the desired channel name in the area provided, and click <b>OK</b>.  You will then be placed in the designated channel.
<BR><BR>

As an alternative to the Channel button, the /join command may be used to quickly join a desired channel.  
Usage: <b>/join [channel name]</b>  Example: "/join MyChannel"
<BR><BR>

Note that the terms "join" and "create" may often be used interchangeably when referring to battle.net chat channels.  
If a channel is empty when you enter it, then you are "creating" the channel - if it already has players when you enter it, 
then you are "joining" the channel.

<BR><BR>


<!--- 4 CHANNEL TYPES -------------------------->
<P>
There are a few different types of chat channels on battle.net, each with its own set of rules and characteristics:
<BR><BR>

<!---------PUBLIC CHANNEL--------------->
<b>Public channels</b> - certain channel names will be designated by battle.net as Public.  Public channels contain no Operator*, and will filter profanity out of non-whispered messages.

<P>
<!-------PRIVATE CHANNELS-------------------->
<b>Private channels</b> - any created channel that is not designated by battle.net as Public will be a 
Private channel.  Private channels contain a channel Operator and do not filter profanity out of messages.  
To become the channel Operator, one must join the channel when it is empty, or must be designated as the 
channel's heir by the current Operator.
<BR><BR>

<!-------CLAN CHANNELS--------------------->
<B>Clan channels</b> - Clan channels are Private channels, but unlike other Private channels each Clan channel 
has a specific Clan Operator.  The Clan Operator will always gain Operator status when he enters his Clan 
channel, and no other account can become Operator unless the channel's current Operator designates him.
If a channel’s Clan Operator leaves his channel without designating someone, then the channel will have no 
Operator until the Clan Operator returns.
<BR><BR>

To create a Clan channel, use the normal channel creation methods but place the word "clan" at the head of the 
channel name, then append the name of the account you wish to use as the channel's Clan Operator.  
<BR><BR>

For example: Warblade wants to create a Clan channel where he was the Clan Operator.  To do this, he types at the battle.net prompt: 
/join Clan Warblade
<BR><BR>

Second example:  The clan "DarkPeaches" with clan leader Slobbo-khan{DP} wants a Clan channel. Slobbo-khan{DP} creates a 
channel with the name "Clan Slobbo-khan{DP}" and he becomes the Clan Operator. If he created the channel "Clan DarkPeaches" he 
would not be the Operator because his name is not DarkPeaches.<BR><BR>

A Clan Operator may, if he wishes, designate an additional Operator for his channel by using the /designate chat 
command on the desired account then reentering his Clan channel.  His designate will become a temporary 
Operator in the Clan channel for as long as he remains in the channel.
<BR><Br>

<a name="ops"></a>
<b>*Operator</b>: the Operator in a channel has the power to kick others from the channel, or to kick them and ban them from 
reentering.  An account banned from a channel by an Operator will remain banned as long as the Operator remains in the 
channel.  Operator-only commands may be found on the battle.net <a href="commands.htm">Chat Commands</a> page.
