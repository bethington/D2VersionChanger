 <B>Someone is harassing me with private messages. What can I do?</B>
  <UL>
  <BR>If someone is sending you messages you do not wish to receive, using the /ignore command, followed by the troublesome players name, will block incoming messages from that person.
  If you are having trouble ignoring a user, it may be due to the fact that you have not correctly entered his name.
  <BR>Type /ignore, then select the user and push the Ctrl and N keys at the same time.

  <P>Also, you can take advantage of the Do Not Disturb command to stop all incoming messages.
  Type "/DND", followed by the reason you do not wished to be disturbed.
  This will send that message to people attempting to privately message you and you will no longer receive private messages.
    <UL>
    <BR>Example: /DND I am busy trying to take over the world and can't talk right now.
  </UL>

  <P>
  Type "/DND" again to disable the Do Not Disturb function and again receive private messages.

<B>I am having a problem with a specific user. What can I do?</B>
<UL>
<BR>Rather than engaging in chat room battles, the best thing you can do when you have a problem with a specific user is to ignore or squelch them.
<LI>Select the user's name from the chat list.
<LI>Next type /ignore then hold down the Ctrl and N keys.
<LI>This will insert the player's name into the chat line, making it easier to enter names that have numerous ASCII characters or odd spellings.
