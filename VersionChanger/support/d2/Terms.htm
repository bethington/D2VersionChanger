    <BR><B>Q:</B> I have a weapon with the Deadly Strike special ability.  What does that mean?
    <BR><B>A:</B> Weapons with the Deadly Strike ability have a chance of dealing double damage.  This bonus is applied after skills, such as Critical Strike, and any other damage bonuses. If you have Critical Strike and Deadly Strike, you can do up to 4x damage in a single hit!

    <P><B>Q:</B> How about the Open Wounds special ability?
    <BR><B>A:</B> When a weapon with the Open Wounds ability strikes a monster, there is a chance the monster will bleed uncontrollably.  The monster will lose health while bleeding.

    <P><B>Q:</B> How about the Crushing Blow special ability?
    <BR><B>A:</B> When a weapon with the Crushing Blow ability strikes a monster, there is a chance the monster will be reduced to 50% of its current life.

    <P><B>Q:</B> My character has a 100% better chance of getting a magic item.  Why isn't every item I get magical?
    <BR><B>A:</B> A character's percentage bonus of finding a magic item is applied to a monster's base chance of dropping a magic item.  For example: if a monster's chance to drop a magic item is 1% and a character with a +100% chance of finding a magic item kills the monster, then his chance of finding a magic item from that monster is 2%.  If the monster's base chance was 40%, then the character's chance of finding a magic item from the monster would be 80%.

    <P><B>Q:</B> I put on an item that has a defense rating of 10 but my character's overall defense rating goes up by more than 10.  Why?
    <BR><B>A:</B> Your Dexterity bonus might account for this, as might passive skills (such as Iron skin) or any magical bonuses that boost defense rating by a percentage (such as auras).

    <P><B>Q:</B> I have an item that says: "10% (life or mana) stolen per hit."  What does this mean?
    <BR><B>A:</B> If you have a 10% life or mana stealing item and hit for 100 points of damage you will gain 10 points of life or mana.

    <P><B>Q:</B> I have an item that says: "requirements -50%"  Does that apply only to this item or all my items?
    <BR><B>A:</B> This will decrease the requirements for this item only by 50%.  If you originally needed a strangth of 100 to use this item you now need a strangth of 50.

    <P><B>Q:</B> I have an item that says: "damage reduced by 1" and another item that says "magic damage reduced by 1."  What is considered magic damage and what is considered non-magic damage?
    <BR><B>A:</B> Non-magic damage comes from weapons and hand-to-hand attacks. A character or monster swinging a sword, claw, fist, etc. as well as shooting an arrow, does non-magic damage.  Magic damage is fire, cold, lightning and poison. Some attacks do both kinds of damage - Magic and Non-Magic. For example: an axe of thunder, does non-magic, physical damage and magic, lightning damage.
