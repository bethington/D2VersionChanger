Where can I send suggestions for games?
</font></b>

<blockquote>
<p align=justify>
We appreciate the time and energy people put into making suggestions for our current and future 
games. Our company policy, however, prevents us from accepting for review any unsolicited ideas. 
Often in our industry, an idea being submitted will be identical or similar to one already used 
by other companies, or already being independently developed by or for a company. Therefore, 
Blizzard Entertainment® has adopted the unalterable policy of refusing to accept or look at any 
unsolicited submissions or ideas.

What is Blizzard Entertainment's® copyright / trademark policy for the Internet, specifically for 
fan sites? Can I use Blizzard Entertainment's® images, text or sound on my web page? Is it ok if

any files, codes, audio or images incorporated in or generated by the software (collectively the

notices contained or associated with such Downloaded Content. You acknowledge and agree that you 
may not sublicense, assign or otherwise transfer this license or the Downloaded Content and that 
no title to the Downloaded Content has been or will be transferred to you from Blizzard 
Entertainment® or anyone else. You also agree that you will not alter, disassemble, decompile, 
reverse engineer or otherwise modify the Downloaded Content.
<p align=justify>

Also, we reserve the right to revoke this limited use license at any time, for any reason, and at
