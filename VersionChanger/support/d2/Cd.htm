  </OL>

  <P><B>If this does not fix the problems chances are this computer will not be able to read the CD.</B>
  <UL>
    Almost all CDs have flaws in them; one CD-ROM drive may not be able to read a CD while another can.  You should try taking the CD back to the place of purchase.  If they will not exchange the CD for another then contact the Blizzard Entertainment Sales Department for more information.
