  <B>What Happens When Your Character Dies:</B>
  <UL>
    <BR>Your character loses a percentage of the total gold both carried and stored in the Stash. The percentage is equal to your character level -- but not to exceed 20%. After deducting the death penalty from the gold your character is carrying, the rest falls to the ground in a pile. If the penalty uses up the gold being carried, the remainder of the penalty is deducted from the Stash.

    <P>
    However, in Single Player the death penalty will not take away all your gold. No gold is taken from the Stash and 500 gold per character level is exempt from the death penalty. For example, if a level 10 Single Player character with 5,000 gold dies, no gold is lost.

    <P>
    As an additional death penalty, in Nightmare and Hell difficulty levels your character loses some experience, but will not drop down to a lower character level.

    <P>
    For information on Hardcore characters, games, and their death penalty check the <A HREF="hardcore.htm">Hardcore page</A>.
